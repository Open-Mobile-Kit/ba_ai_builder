Create a comprehensive feature plan based on the project analysis and system architecture:

**Project Analysis:**
{{analysis}}

**System Architecture:**
{{architecture}}

Please create a detailed feature plan that includes:

## 1. Core Features (Must-Have)
List the essential features that are critical for the system to meet its primary objectives:
- Feature name and description
- Business value and justification
- User stories and acceptance criteria
- Technical complexity assessment

## 2. Enhanced Features (Should-Have)
List important features that significantly improve the system but are not critical for initial release:
- Feature name and description
- Business value and impact
- Dependencies on core features
- Implementation complexity

## 3. Optional Features (Nice-to-Have)
List features that would be valuable but can be deferred to future releases:
- Feature name and description
- Potential business impact
- Resource requirements
- Future implementation considerations

## 4. Feature Prioritization Matrix
Provide a prioritization framework considering:
- Business value/impact
- Technical complexity
- Resource requirements
- Dependencies
- Risk factors

## 5. Implementation Roadmap
Create a phased implementation plan:
- Phase 1: MVP features
- Phase 2: Core enhancement features
- Phase 3: Advanced features
- Phase 4: Future expansion features

## 6. User Experience Features
- User interface requirements
- User workflow optimizations
- Accessibility features
- Mobile responsiveness

## 7. Technical Features
- Performance optimization features
- Security features
- Monitoring and analytics features
- Administrative features

## 8. Integration Features
- Third-party service integrations
- API capabilities
- Data import/export features
- Legacy system integrations

For each feature, provide:
- Clear description and scope
- User personas and use cases
- Acceptance criteria
- Estimated effort (T-shirt sizing: XS, S, M, L, XL)
- Dependencies and prerequisites
- Success metrics

Ensure features align with the technical architecture and business requirements identified in the analysis phase.
