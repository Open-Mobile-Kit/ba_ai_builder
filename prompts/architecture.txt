- Component responsibilities and interfaces
- Dependencies between components
- Component interaction patterns

## 3. Technology Stack Recommendations
- Backend technologies and frameworks
- Frontend technologies and frameworks
- Mobile technologies and frameworks
- Database technologies
- Infrastructure and deployment technologies
- Third-party services and APIs

## 4. Data Architecture
- Data models and schemas
- Data storage strategies
- Data flow and processing
- Data security and privacy considerations

## 5. Security Architecture
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Data encryption and protection
- Security protocols and standards
- Threat mitigation strategies

## 6. Integration Architecture
- External system integrations
- API design and management
- Message queuing and communication
- Service orchestration

## 7. Deployment and Infrastructure
- Deployment strategy and environments
- Scalability and load balancing
- Monitoring and logging
- Backup and disaster recovery

## 8. Performance Considerations
- Performance optimization strategies
- Caching mechanisms
- Resource optimization
- Scalability planning

Ensure the architecture is scalable, maintainable, secure, and aligns with the project requirements and constraints identified in the analysis.
